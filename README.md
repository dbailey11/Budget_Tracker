Budget Tracker is a full stack application that uses Express and MongoDB to track a user's expenses. The application provides offline functionality which allows users to keep track of their expenses even if they are out of network and not able to connect. Users will be able to enter any expendatures offline and their data will be cached. Once back online the cached data will then get added to the server and officially stored.
